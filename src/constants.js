The project analyzes key financial indicators such as liquidity ratios, profitability metrics, and debt levels to identify patterns associated with financial distress. After performing data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, multiple classification models are trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate predictor. The final model classifies companies as “bankrupt” or “non-bankrupt,” helping in risk assessment, investment decisions, and financial planning. This project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation.",
